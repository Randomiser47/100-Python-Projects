# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a **simple number guessing game** built in Python. The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess the number. The player can choose between **easy mode (10 lives)** or **hard mode (5 lives)**.

## How to Play

1. The game starts by displaying a logo (if available in `art` module).
2. The player is prompted to choose between **easy mode** (10 lives) or **hard mode** (5 lives).
3. The game will then ask the player to make a guess.
4. The program will provide feedback:
   - **Too high** â†’ The guess is greater than the selected number.
   - **Too low** â†’ The guess is smaller than the selected number.
   - **Correct!** â†’ The player wins the game.
5. If the player **runs out of lives**, the game reveals the correct number.
